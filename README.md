# Content and sentiment analysis of Telegram channels
Six Telegram channels that differ in their views on some important subjects were selected for content and sentiment analysis. Although it is possible to extract transcripts from audio/image/video data, it would have required a lot of time to download all the content, disk space to store it, and processing power. This is why sentiment analysis was performed only on text data.
